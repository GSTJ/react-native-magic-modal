// This package exists to make `react-native-magic-modal` and `magic-modal` the
// same install. That only holds if three things stay identical: the version,
// the peer dependency ranges, and which of those peers are optional.
//
// The version matters because the dependency below is `workspace:*`, which pnpm
// rewrites at pack time to the exact version of the linked workspace package.
// Publishing the shim at 10.0.0 with a `magic-modal` dependency pinned to
// 10.0.0 is the lockstep. A stale shim version would publish a duplicate of an
// already-released version number and fail, or worse, succeed with the wrong
// contents.
//
// The peers matter because npm surfaces a missing peer differently for a direct
// dependency than for a transitive one, and because `react-native-screens` is
// optional. Someone who installs the old name should see exactly the warnings
// they saw before the rename.
//
// Run with `--check` (what `pnpm test` does) to fail on drift, or `--write`
// (what the release does) to fix it.
