/**
 * The browser chrome's layout, as static CSS.
 *
 * This replaces `StyleSheet.create` and react-native-web's style pipeline. That
 * pipeline — the StyleSheet compiler, styleq, inline-style-prefixer,
 * normalize-colors and the React Native-to-DOM prop translation around them —
 * was over half of what a web app downloaded for this library, to produce a
 * handful of rules that never change.
 *
 * The rules are a faithful copy of what react-native-web compiled the old
 * `StyleSheet` to, including the parts of its `View` reset that a page's own
 * CSS could otherwise break: a consumer with `div { padding: 8px }` used to get
 * the same layout as everyone else and still has to.
 *
 * `MODAL_STYLESHEET` is a constant string rendered inside a `<style>` element
 * by the portal, not injected into `document.head`. Nothing here touches the
 * DOM at module scope, so a Next.js server component can import this file, and
 * the CSS is already in the server-rendered HTML — there is no frame where the
 * modal is unstyled.
