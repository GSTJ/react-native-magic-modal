// Control for tools/changelog-preset.mjs.
//
// The preset decides which commit types reach the changelog and which of them
// can move the version, so the risk it carries is silent omission: mark a type
// hidden and its commits vanish with no error anywhere. A breaking change
// vanishing that way is the one failure this package cannot ship.
//
// POLICY below is written out longhand on purpose. Deriving it from the
// preset's own type list would make every assertion a tautology — hide a
// section and the check would just change its mind about what it expected. So
// the policy is stated here, the preset is asserted to match it, and the
// rendered output is asserted to match it too. Changing what reaches the
// changelog means changing both files, deliberately.
//
// Three things get checked:
//
//   1. the type list agrees with the policy
//   2. a synthetic history of every type renders the way the policy says,
//      including the `ci!:` case — `ci` is hidden and its breaking note still
//      has to surface
//   3. the recommended bump respects `effect`, so a release of nothing but
//      `build:` and `chore:` commits cannot come out a minor
//   4. a breaking note is only taken from a real footer, so prose that merely
//      starts a line with the words "breaking change" cannot compute a major
//
// Then it renders the same history through a sabotaged type list and fails if
// *that* passes. An assertion that cannot fail is worth nothing. (4) carries
// its own control of the same kind: the prose case is re-run through
// upstream's default note pattern and has to come out a major there, which is
// what makes it a regression test rather than a restatement.
