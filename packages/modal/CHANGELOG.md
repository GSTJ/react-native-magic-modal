### Breaking Change

The component has been fully restructured not to depend on react-native-modal and have full control, using react-native-reanimated. Some properties are not available anymore, please refer to the docs for a full list of supported properties.

If you happened to use the library for an use-case not supported anymore, with no equivalent properties, please open an issue.
